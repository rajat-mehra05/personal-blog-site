Hi ðŸ‘‹ <br />
What is this ?
'this' in JavaScript is set to the current environment in which the function is being executed.
Often good programmers find it astounding and confusing and have a vague citation to this keyword.
Hence, to clearly define the object to which this keyword belongs, we need to use methods like bind(), call() and apply().
