# To create an Abell project locally with the template that I am using

> npx create-abell-app my-blog --template abelljs/abell-starter-minima

# Write/Edit blogs

- Take a local copy of your blog `git clone <blog-github-url>`
- cd to the new cloned folder
- `npm run dev` to run a dev server
  The new repository will have a `content` folder in the root directory.
  You can edit blogs from there and you can create a new folder with `index.md` to create a new blog.

To see the final output, you can build the site with `npm run build`
